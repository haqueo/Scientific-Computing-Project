\section{Solution Strategy}

In this coursework, I will use the algorithmic steps provided to design a workflow and job schedule that minimises the duration of the processes while maximising the number of processes that can be executed in parallel. \\
Rather than describing a strategy in one section and providing the implementation in another, I will be running through each of the steps and describing the functions used in chronological order, finishing on the main code.
\subsection{Extract data}
In order to make this program as robust and as general as possible, I have written a csv file which contains the data from Table 1.1 of the question, i.e the List of jobs, their duration and dependencies.
The function \textit{extract\_data} uses the csv module to iterate through every row of the datafile, and combine them into a numpy array.

\begin{python} 
def extract_data(file_name):
    global completed_before, duration
    # e.g. file_name = './data/jobslist'
    job = []
    duration = []
    completed_before = []

    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:

        AAA = csv.reader(file)

        for i, row in enumerate(AAA):

            job.append(int(row[0]))

            duration.append(int(row[1]))

            if len(row) > 2:
                completed_before.append([int(node) for node in row[2:]])

            else:
                completed_before.append([])

    file.close()

    data_frame = np.column_stack((job, duration, completed_before))

    return data_frame
\end{python}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{np.array produced from extract\_data}
\centering
\includegraphics{data}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Constructing the graph}
We now construct the directed graph, as described in steps \textbf{1,2,3} and \textbf{4} of algorithm 1.1 in the question. For job $m \in \{ 0,1,\dots, 12 \}$ I write $m_{s}$ and $m_{f}$ to mean the start and finish node for job m respectively. I also write $v_{s}$ and $v_{f}$ to mean the virtual start and virtual finish node respectively.



I will construct an adjacency matrix, $W = \{ w_{i,j} \}$, where $w_{i,j}$ denotes the edge weight between node $i$ and node $j$. The ordering of the matrix rows and columns is the following sequence $$ 0_{s} 1_{s} \dots 12_{s} 0_{f} 1_{f} \dots 12_{f} v_{s} v_{f}$$
The weights $w_{i,j}$ are specified by steps \textbf{1,2,3} and \textbf{4} of algorithm 1.1, I write the conditions here. $\forall$ jobs m,n $\in \{ 0,1,\dots 12\}$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $w_{m_{s},m_{f}}$ = the duration of job m. By inspection, the duration of a job is always strictly positive.
  \item $w_{m_{f},n_{s}}$ = 0 if job m has to be completed before job n.
  \item $w_{v_{s},m_{s}} = 0$
  \item $w_{m_{f},v_{f}} = 0$
\end{itemize}

Else, we take a value of $w_{i,j} = -1$ if node $i$ is not connected to node $j$. 

\subsection{Finding the longest path}
\subsection{Finding the earliest start and stop times}
\subsection{Producing the Gantt chart}
\section{Main Solution Code}

The code in \textit{solution\_final.py} contains the main program which carries out the process outlined by the question, i.e modelling the process of the cars moving across the city of Rome using the rules described. I have added scripts \textit{solution\_epsilon0.py} and \textit{solution\_accident\_occurs} to help answer the related questions at the end of the project.
\newline

Below are the imports used by the main program.

\begin{python}
# Imports
import numpy as np
import csv
import sys
import math as ma

# This import is needed for the last question
from solution_accident_occurs import max_index_tracker_no30
\end{python}

the variable \textit{max\_index\_tracker\_no30} is imported from another python script, 
\newline
\textit{solution\_accident\_occurs.py} in order to answer one of the questions. This will be discussed in detail later.
\leavevmode
\newline

Below are the functions required by the program. The docstring's explain their use.\
note: I will explain the use of the function away\_from\_52 properly later in the document.

\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Determine for each node the maximum load (maximum number of cars) over the 200 iterations.}
\newline

As we have already incorporated the calculation of maximums in the loop, this is easy:

\begin{python}
max_index_tracker = [[node+1, max_cars_at_node[node]]
                         for node in range(total_nodes)]
\end{python}

Thus the i'th element of this array gives [node i, maximum number of cars of node i over the 200 iterations ]. The code to print is below along with the output.

\begin{python}
print('max_index_tracker is')
print(max_index_tracker[0:10])
print(max_index_tracker[10:20])
print(max_index_tracker[20:30])
print(max_index_tracker[30:40])
print(max_index_tracker[40:50])
print(max_index_tracker[50:(len(max_index_tracker)+1)])
\end{python}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{output of maximum loads}
\centering

\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Which are the five most congested nodes?} \newline
Given this array \textit{max\_index\_tracker}, we can simply sort by the second argument to find the top five most congested nodes
\begin{python}
top_five = sorted(max_index_tracker,
                      key=lambda node_and_max: -1 * node_and_max[1])[:5]
print('the five most congested nodes are')
print(top_five)
\end{python}

In other words, the top five most congested nodes (from highest to lowest) is node 52 with 63 cars, node 25 with 40 cars, node 21 with 38 cars, node 30 with 32 cars and node 43 with 31 cars.

\item \textbf{Which edges are not utilized at all? Why?}
\leavevmode
\newline

In the main program we defined a 58x58 boolean matrix of False's, where throughout the process if cars moved from index i to index j, we made the [i,j] element of the matrix True.
\leavevmode
\newline

Thus, we have a matrix where indices (corresponding to edges) are \textit{True} if they are traversed by some amount of cars ($ > 0$) in the 200 minute process.
\leavevmode
\newline

All that is left to do is count the number of False's, making sure that we don't count a False if the edge couldn't be traversed to begin with (in the original weight matrix). This corresponds to an element of the original weight matrix being 0.

\begin{python}
# create a boolean matrix that corresponds to the condition
# described above
non_utilised_edges_matrix = (weight_matrix != float(0)) \
                                & (np.logical_not(edge_utilised))
                                
non_utilised_edges = [[i+1, j+1] for i in range(total_nodes)
                          for j in range(total_nodes)
                          if non_utilised_edges_matrix[i, j]]

\end{python}

So an element $[l,m]$ belonging to this vector \textit{non\_utilised\_edges} implies that the edge $l \to m$ is not utilised.

The code to print this and the output is below.

\begin{python}
print('the non utilised edges are')
print(non_utilised_edges[0:10])
print(non_utilised_edges[10:20])
print(non_utilised_edges[20:30])
print(non_utilised_edges[30:40])
print(non_utilised_edges[40:50])
print(non_utilised_edges[50:60])
print(non_utilised_edges[60:(len(non_utilised_edges)+1)])
\end{python}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{list of non utilised edges output}
\centering

\end{figure}

Now I answer \textit{why} these edges aren't utilised. 


For the vast majority of unused edges, it is intuitively clear that the reason they are included is because they are pointing completely away from the direction towards node 52. For example, I have highlighted edges $4 \to 1$, $12 \to 4$ and $52 \to 58$ in figure 3.4.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{City of Rome graph map with drawn edges}
\centering

\end{figure}
 
These edges in particular are not only in the wrong in the x direction, but wrong in the y direction too. I have created the function \textit{away\_from\_52} below to return a boolean depending on whether a given edge is pointing completely away from node 52. i.e. in both x and y direction.

\leavevmode
\newline
\leavevmode
\newline



\begin{python}
def away_from_52(edge):
    """
    Tells you whether a given edge is pointing completely away from
    node 52, in both the x and y directions.
    :param edge: an edge of the form [a,b]
    :return: boolean whether or not this points to or away from 52
    """

    # extract data for access to global variables
    extract_data()

    # the edge is of the form [a,b]
    a = edge[0]
    b = edge[1]

    # use RomeX and RomeY to find the coordinates for a,b and node 52.
    a_coord = [RomeX[a - 1], RomeY[a - 1]]
    b_coord = [RomeX[b - 1], RomeY[b - 1]]
    coord52 = [RomeX[51], RomeY[51]]

    # find the change in x/y from a -> b
    x_change = b_coord[0] - a_coord[0]
    y_change = b_coord[1] - a_coord[1]

    # find the change in x/y from a -> 52
    x_changeTo52 = coord52[0] - a_coord[0]
    y_changeto52 = coord52[1] - a_coord[1]

    # if we're at 52 we're moving away from it
    if a == 52:
        return True

    # if both point in same direction, false.
    if (x_changeTo52 > 0) and (x_change > 0):
        return False
    elif (x_changeTo52 < 0) and (x_change < 0):
        return False

    # if both point in same direction, false.
    if (y_changeto52 > 0) and (y_change > 0):
        return False
    elif (y_changeto52 < 0) and (y_change < 0):
        return False

    # all other tests have passed, so must be True.
    return True  
\end{python}

We then run this to find the number of edges facing completely away from node 52.

\begin{python}
new_unused = list(non_utilised_edges)

for _, edge in enumerate(non_utilised_edges):
	if away_from_52(edge):
	new_unused.remove(edge)

print('length of new_unused is %i' % len(new_unused))
\end{python}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{length of new\_unused list}
\centering

\end{figure}

So out of 71 unused edges, 41 of them were facing completely away from node 52. In a similar way we can remove nodes that are facing away from node 52 in the x direction only. 

I print the remaining edges below

\begin{python}
    print(new_unused[0:10])
    print(new_unused[10:20])
    print(new_unused[20:31])
\end{python}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{list of unused edges that aren't facing completely away from node 52}
\centering
\end{figure}



We note that from the first question where we found the maximum load for all cars over the 200 iterations, it is clear that nodes with maximum load 0 (i.e. node 3, 5, 8 etc) will always appear on this list since they were never visited. However, the real question is \textit{why} they were never visited. \\

If we perform Dijkstra's algorithm on the original weight matrix and find the fastest route form node 13 to 52, we find this:

\begin{python}
print(Dijkst(12,51,weight_matrix))
\end{python}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Dijkstra's algorithm path from 13 to 52 (python indices)}
\centering

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Dijkstra's algorithm path from 13 to 52 with constant weight matrix}
\centering

\end{figure}



note that these are the python indices and not the actual node numbers.

If we look at figure 3.8, this means without taking the effect of congestion, the fastest path throughout the city is almost completely at the bottom of the map, by the river. This means that it is unlikely for a car to need to travel through the upper west side of the city, such as through nodes 1,3,5 and 2. The only way the shortest path for a car could include such nodes is if the rest of the city is \textit{so} congested that the shortest path will indeed require these upper left nodes. We can see that edges like [3,2], [8,9] are not optimal for this reason, and are thus unused.

There are lots of edges that although aren't facing in the wrong direction in both the x and y direction, but will obviously never lead to an optimal solution. Such as [57,55] and [56,54]. This is because these nodes have a very small degree, 2 or 3. So if the optimal path runs through them (in the opposite direction), the other direction which tracks backwards will not be part of an optimal solution.

We can also consider the fact that if an edge is used by cars, the inverse of that edge is unlikely to be used again. This makes sense if we consider that 71 edges are unused out of a total of 156 edges (almost 1/2). So if we compare all the edges available to use and the edges unused, we should find a high correlation between pairs of the form [a,b] and [b,a] existing in either set. This is another reason highly used edges like [55,57] and [56,54] are not traversed in the opposite direction, as discussed in the paragraph above.

\item \textbf{What flow pattern do we observe for parameter $\epsilon = 0$?}

See the \textit{solution\_epsilon0.py} file. The main program is exactly the same, but for one change. I have replaced epsilon = 0.01 with epsilon = float(0) where we update the weight matrix in the main for loop.

\begin{python}
temp_wei = update_weight_matrix(float(0), cars_at_node, weight_matrix)
\end{python}

Now, if we consider the formula for the adjusted weight matrix at each iteration, where $w_{ij} = w_{ij}^{(0)} + \epsilon \frac{c_{i} + c_{j}}{2}$, we see that the weight matrix remains unchanged.

As discussed in lectures, Dijkstra's algorithm is an example of a greedy algorithm. Since the time discrete process we are modelling uses Dijkstra's algorithm one node at a time (with the same weight matrix), we know that the shortest path from node 13 to node 52 will remain constant throughout the process.

Furthermore, let P be a node on the shortest path between node 13 and 52,

$$ 13 \to .. \to \ P \to p_{1} \to ... \to p_{n-1} \to 52 $$

Then the shortest path from node P to node 52 is 

$$ P \to p_{1} \to ... \to p_{n-1} \to 52 $$

Since the weight matrix is unchanged. If the shortest path between node P and node 52 were anything else then the shortest path between node 13 and node 52 would not be $13 \to ... \to P \to p_{1} \to ... \to p_{n-1} \to 52$.

In other words, finding the shortest path from node to node with a constant weight matrix is the same as finding the overall shortest path using the same weight matrix. We can simply use the utilised edges to see that the flow of cars in the system follows this path. Printing the cars\_at\_node vector throughout the 200 minutes verifies this.

\begin{python}
# regular dijkstra's path
print('the Dijkstra\'s path is ')
print(dijk.Dijkst(12, 51, weight_matrix))

utilised_edges = [[i, j] for i in range(noNodes) 
                  for j in range(noNodes) 
                  if edge_utilised[i, j]] # this matrix is defined in the main 
                  			       #code
print('the utilised edges are')
print(utilised_edges)
\end{python}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Dijkstra's path with utilised edges output (both in Python indices for clarity)}
\centering

\end{figure}

Since all of these edges have a distinct head to tail connection, I can be sure the cars follow the path in the order we expect.


\item \textbf{An accident occurs at node 30 (python-index 29) which blocks any route to or from node 30. Which nodes are now the most congested and what is their maximum load? Which nodes (besides node 30) decrease the most in peak value, which nodes in- crease the most in peak value?}

See \textit{solution\_accident\_occurs.py}. The main code is exactly the same as before, but for these changes:

Since no car can reach node 30, we need to make the 30th row and 30th column of the weight matrix equal to 0s. 

\begin{python}
# Use the calcWei function from tutorials, along with the data set given
# to calculate the weight matrix. Also create a copy which is the
# temporary weight matrix.
weight_matrix = calcWei(RomeX, RomeY, RomeA, RomeB, RomeV)

# The accident at node 30 means that the 30th row and 30th column is all 0
weight_matrix[29, :] = np.zeros(58, dtype=float)
weight_matrix[:, 29] = np.zeros(58, dtype=float)

temp_wei = weight_matrix.copy()
\end{python}

Once we begin the for loop iterating through the 200 minutes, we compute the next nodes as before. But there is no path between node 30 and 52, so we add this "if node!=29" statement to the next\_nodes calculation.

We also insert a 0 at index 29, so the nodes align properly again.

\begin{python}
# Iterate through the 200 minutes
for i in range(minutes):

    # Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fastest path to node 52 in
    # the system. Then use next_node to find the next node in the given
    # path. (step 1)
    next_nodes = [next_node(Dijkst(node, 51, temp_wei))
                  for node in range(total_nodes) if node != 29]

    next_nodes.insert(29, 29)  # send the 0 cars from 29 to itself
\end{python}

We can ignore node 30 when moving the cars through the system, so we add this else if statement.

\begin{python}
 for j_node in range(total_nodes):

        if j_node == 51:
            # We remove 40% of cars from node 52.
            cars_at_node_updated[51] += int(round(cars_at_node[51] * 0.6))
            # really, we can just ignore node 30.
        elif j_node != 29:
\end{python}

Now we create this variable max\_index\_tracker\_no30, which is simply the array of all the nodes with the maximum load they carry over the 200 iterations. This is then imported into the \textit{solution\_final.py} file as outlined before.

\begin{python}
# Find the top 5 most congested nodes.
max_index_tracker_no30 = [[node+1, max_cars_at_node[node]]
                          for node in range(total_nodes)]
\end{python}

Now, back in \textit{solution\_final.py} we compare and print the required values.

\begin{python}
top_eight = sorted(max_index_tracker_no30, 
                       key=lambda node_and_max: -1 * node_and_max[1])[:8]
print(top_eight)
\end{python}

These are the top 8 most congested nodes when node 30 is blocked.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Top 8 most congested nodes with maximum loads when node 30 is blocked}
\centering

\end{figure}

\leavevmode
\newline



Now we find the nodes which increase/decrease the most in peak value.

\begin{python}
    differences = []
    for k in range(total_nodes):
        if k == 29:
            differences.append([k+1, 0])  # ignore when analysing
        else:
            differences.append([k+1, max_index_tracker[k][1] 
                                - max_index_tracker_no30[k][1]])

    sorted_differences_most = \
        sorted(differences, 
               key=lambda node_and_max: -1 * node_and_max[1])[:8]
    sorted_differences_least = \
        sorted(differences, 
               key=lambda node_and_max: node_and_max[1])[:8]
    print(sorted_differences_most)
    print(sorted_differences_least)
\end{python}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{The top 8 nodes which increased the most in peak value, followed by (next line) the top 8 nodes that decreased the most in peak value, all with their difference in peak values.}
\centering

\end{figure}

These elements represents the node number and the difference in maximum load from before to when node 30 is congested. So for example, node 6 increased its peak value by 5, and node 43 decreased its peak value by 14.

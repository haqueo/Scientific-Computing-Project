#Question 1

#Write a main function that sums all numbers divisible by 3 or 5 less than n, but not by both.
#Useful functions you may want to use
#This main function should read n from the command line and print the sum (preferably with some text).

#Question 2

#Create a function that takes an input n and creates an nxn square power matrix, where the (i,j) component is j^i.
#Then using numpy find the inverse of this matrix

#Question 3

#In matlab we have start/end/step capability, and although range is quite good, it doesn't work for non-integers.
#Write a function that returns a list of numbers between start and stop with step size step.
